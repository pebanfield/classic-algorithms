This repository contains solutions to hackerrank.com problems in the algorithms
domain.

Note : To run the solutions you will need to place the body of the processData
function within the routine of the same name on the hackerrank site where you
see the comments -

// write your code here.

Also note that you will need to output the solution result to the console.
In other words, the full solution is split into both the algorithm routine
and it's accompanying test spec.
