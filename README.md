This repository contains solutions to hackerrank.com problems in the algorithms
domain.

https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms

These are my personal solutions intended to showcase my learning and competency
with classic algorithms. Disclaimer - I am a UX Engineer and JavaScript developer
by trade. I am not classically trained in Computer Science and welcome feedback.

Note : To run the solutions you will need to place the body of the processData
function within the routine of the same name on the hackerrank site where you
see the comments -

// write your code here.

Also note that you will need to output the solution result to the console. There
is a STDOUT method that you can call within the hackerrank editor but I found
that you could also output with the more familiar console.log() statement.

Generally speaking, I found the hackerrank UX to be lacking in some areas. My
preference is to use modern debug tools and my IDE of choice. It is faster as it
does not require a server round trip and is less likely to crash. So I generally
develop the solutions away from the hackerrank UI and then paste them in when
I want to run and submit them.
